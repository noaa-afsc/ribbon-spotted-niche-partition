# Abstract

In deep-diving seals (_Phocidae_) niche partitioning has been observed as
delineation in time, multi-dimensional use of the ocean, or diet composition.
Here, we focus on two species of seals in the Bering Sea -- ribbon seals
(_Histriophoca fasciata_) and spotted seals (_Phoca largha_) -- and evidence for
niche partitioning from two decades of bio-logger deployments (n=110 ribbon;
n=82 spotted) and stable isotope sampling (n=29 ribbon; n=43 spotted).
Whiskers of dependent pups in the spring reflect the isotopic space of adult
female diet in the winter (when the pup was developing in-utero) and sampling
from the whisker base of adults in the spring corresponds with the isotopic
space of their recent diet. In both seasons, spotted seals had higher mean
δ13C (winter: +6.9%; spring: +3.8%) and δ15N (winter: +10.5%; spring = +12.1%)
values, which are reflective of on-shelf and coastal foraging at a higher
trophic level. Two-dimensional utilization distributions (UD) were estimated
from bio-logger geolocations for each species during similar seasonal periods
('spring' and 'fall-winter'). Optimally weighted auto-correlated kernel
density estimates were combined into a population UD to test spatial overlap.
Greater overlap was observed in the spring when both species rely on the
marginal sea-ice zone for pupping, breeding, and molting. More separation was
observed during the fall-winter season when spotted seals remained largely on
the continental shelf and ribbon seals shifted to the shelf break and Bering
Sea basin. Dive behavior records showed ribbon seals consistently diving to
deeper depths (max dive depth = ~600m) compared to spotted seals (max dive
depth = ~300m) indicating additional partitioning of resources within the
water column. Changes in the extent and timing of sea ice in the Bering Sea
along with anomalous warming events could disrupt the niche partitioning
between these seal species and, thus, challenge their resilience to climate
change.
